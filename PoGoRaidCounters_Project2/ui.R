                  "Pokemon Go Raids are pretty popular in Durham and Raleigh these days.
                  People gather together at random points of interest called 'gyms' and
                  battle against a computer boss Pokemon.  Tier 5 Raids can be pretty difficult!
                  You only get one unpaid raid per day, so you have to make them count.
                  To do so, you need a good knowledge of how to make a party based on
                  what Pokemon you are going up against!  This app will help show you the 
                  best counters against a boss based on their type-adjusted Damage Per Second
                  (DPS).  The formulas on the right show how I calculated DPS and adjusted DPS based
                  on real data from the original games.  These are the same formulas that the
                  developers use (minus Mewtwo who infamously received a nerf for being OP).
                  Check out this link for more info on damage mechanics!

                               $$Damage=Power*\\frac{Attack}{Defense}*Multiplier)+1$$
                                The damage multiplier, though, changes based on the type of attack being used
                                and the opponent's type.  For example, a pokemon using a 'Fire' based attack
                                would be very effective against 'grass' but ineffective against 'water.'
                                We can dynamically find the damage-type multiplier for each pokemon based on the raid boss.
                                $$Fast Atk Mult=$$
                                $$(FastMove*BossType1)*(FastMoveAdv*BossType2)$$
                                $$Charged Atk Mult=$$
                                $$(ChargedMoveAdv*BossType1)*(ChargedMoveAdv*BossType2)$$
                                $$Total Damage Multiplier=$$
                                $$Average(Fast Mult,Charged Mult)$$
                                Assuming that roughly half of the damage is from the fast attack and half
                                is from the charged attack.  Then, the Adjusted DPS is:
                                $$AdjDPS= DPS * Total Multiplier$$
                                You can see the values for this chart in the 'Advantages' table.
